# ToDoAPP 

## A MERN To Do App builted with React, Redux , NodeJS and MongoDB

For this project I used react, react-router, redux, redux-multi, redux-thunk and redux-promise, and on the backend I used NodeJS (Express) and MongoDB(mongoose). Also set up Webpack and Babel. Feel free to clone it and use it. 

Scripts for running "npm run dev". Just run it on frontend and backend and use the app on http://localhost:8080
